Data Bootcamp Week Eleven Data Scraping

The purpose of this project was to scrape Martian data from websites and create DataFrames for analysis. The goal was to examine the variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure on Mars over different months, using the scraped data to uncover patterns and trends.

Through this project, I learned how to scrape data from websites and convert it into structured DataFrames for analysis. I then applied the concepts weâ€™ve covered in class, such as data grouping, aggregation, and visualization, to analyze the Martian climate, particularly temperature and pressure fluctuations. This process allowed me to integrate web scraping with data analysis techniques to draw insights from the dataset.
